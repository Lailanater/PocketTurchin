    <string name="gallery_description_1">\n\nThe 320-mile New River begins high in the mountains of
        northwestern North Carolina, deep in the heart of the Southern Appalachians. The New, as it
        is affectionately called, actually begins as two rivers, the North Fork in Ashe County and
        South Fork in Watauga County. The two forks join in Alleghany County and flow north from
        North Carolina’s Blue Ridge into Virginia and West Virginia. One of the oldest rivers in the world
        and certainly the oldest in the United States, the headwaters of the New wind more than 100 miles through
        the Appalachians; the forks join just a few miles south of the North Carolina-Virginia line.
        The New River continues its somewhat unusual northward flow through southwestern Virginia and West Virginia
        into the Kanawha and Ohio rivers—its waters eventually reaching the Gulf of Mexico by way of the Mississippi River.

        \n\nPartnering with the Center for Appalachian Studies, Tom Hansell’s graduate seminar, Sustainability
        and the Arts in Appalachia (AS5065), and New River Conservancy (NRC) to showcase the headwaters of the
        New River in the northwestern corner of North Carolina, the Turchin Center for the Visual Arts supports
        both the mission of the NRC and Appalachian State University’s commitment to an engaged campus culture
        inspired by the ideal of sustainable communities. The New River Conservancy believes that clean water,
        healthy land and empowered people benefit the surrounding communities by creating a watershed where people
        want to live, work and play.\n</string>

    <string name="gallery_description_2">\n\nWayne Trapp was an enigmatic artist; some would say a Renaissance man
        – the consummate artist who does a bit of everything, always executing his chosen craft well. He had an
        insatiable curiosity, not only for art but also for, well; everything that life offered. With his pipe
        clenched between his teeth, he never stopped making marks—in his journals, on art paper, on canvas, in
        bronze, in stone and in steel. He collected cars, good wine, conversation, read Nietzche and was always
        up for the next adventure. He wrote: “My sense of design and my curiosity of how things are made is as
        innate to me as eating and breathing. The lines and elements of light fixtures, pepper mills, skyscrapers,
        bar stools, writing instruments—virtually all things human made—hold intrigue for me if their designs
        shout form and function.” Trapp made his first sculpture at the age of nine and didn’t stop making until
        his death last November. He had a rich life, he served in the Army, went to art school in Pittsburg,
        while driving a cab to make money, spent a short time as an art director, something, he claimed, turned
        him into a self-described “hippie,” and then farmer and finally a sculptor.

        \n\nThe exhibition at the Turchin Center features a variety of Trapp’s creative work: paintings, drawings in
        pencil and ink on paper and intimate sculptural forms in bronze and steel.\n</string>
